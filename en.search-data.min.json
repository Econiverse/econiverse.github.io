Let’s presume you despot $100 into you Cash account. You would now have $100 “Buying Power”. Should the investor wish to buy a certain security/stock the investor must have the cash available in the brokerage account equal to the total cost.\nExample; Company ABC is trading at $50 per share and you wish to purchase two shares – You would need to have $100 (2 Shares @$50 each) available in your cash account.\nDepending on your brokerage, you may need to pay a fee also known as commission to your Broker to submit and exercise this trade on your behalf. This fee/commission needs to be paid with the overall transaction to exercise your trade.\nIf we use the above example; Company ABC is trading at $50 per share and you wish to purchase two shares, your Broker has a fee of $10 per trade – You would need to have $110 (2 Shares @$50 each = $100 + $10 fee for broker) in your Cash Account for this trade to be valid and submitted and be filled.\n Selling with a Cash Account:    Following on from the above example, two weeks passed and Company ABC is now trading at $60 per share. You wish to sell or exit your position. You’d put in a sell order through your broker to sell your two shares. In this example at $60 each. Once the sell order is executed, you’d have to wait T+2 Days (where is Transaction day + 2 BUSINESS days), once this T+2 period passes the $120 will be reflected in your cash account usually as ’Buying Power’. Until the trade settles, you can\u0026rsquo;t withdraw the money from your brokerage account or use it to make anther purchase.\nMargin Account    A Margin Account allows an investor to borrow against the dollar value of the assets (Cash and/or Securities/shares can be assets) in the account. Investors can use margin accounts to leverage their positions. What does margin and leverage mean? Margin is basically another word for loan/borrow and Leverage is a fancy word for advantage (in your favour).\nLeverage is usually a ratio of sorts (2:1, 4:1, 10:1 or 20:1 for example). In the examples we will use a leverage ratio of 2:1, meaning for every dollar of value you have in your account, your broker is willing to let you borrow two dollars – another way to think of it is; for every dollar you have in your brokerage account your broker is willing to loan you two dollars. So let’s presume your margin account has $5,000 in it, your broker is willing to lend $10,000 you OR allow you to borrow $10,000 – as that will be a 2:1 ratio.\nNow, with every loan you take there is interest, and this loan is no different. Your Broker will advise you of the interest rate – usually a percentage (%) – for the Margin account to which you are required to pay, basically a fee for using their funds.\nBuying example with interest    This section is still a work in progress. You can help by contributing knowledge!\nExample of short position? + Margin call    This section is still a work in progress. You can help by contributing knowledge!\nExample of both Cash and Margin side-by-side where stock goes up:    For example, presume both Cash and Margin Accounts have $5,000 deposited with the Margin given a leverage of 2:1. Additionally the broker has no fee/commission to factor in.\nWeek 1 BUYING - Company ABC is trading at $200 per share\nWeek 2 – SELLING Company ABC trading at $300 per share\nWeek 1    Cash Account (Week 1)\n$5,000 allows the Investor to buy 25 Shares at $200 per share.\nMargin Account (Week 1)\n$10,000 allows the investor to buy 50 shares at $200 per share.\nSo you can see from the above example that both accounts had the same $5,000 deposited to use, the Cash account ended up with 25 Shares while the Margin account still with $5,000 deposited but leveraged 2:1 through their broker ended up with 50 shares.\nNow let’s fast forward a week and sell our shares.\nWeek 2    Cash Account (Week 2)\nSelling 25 shares at $300 per share would equate to $7,500. After T+2 Days you’d have available $7,500 to trade with or withdraw from your brokerage account to say buy yourself something nice.\nMargin Account (Week 2)\nSelling 50 shares at $300 per share would equate to $15,000 and your buying powers would available immediately avoiding the T+2 waiting period.\nExample of both Cash and Margin side-by-side where stock goes down:    This section is still a work in progress.

This type of order guarantees that the order will be executed, but does not guarantee the execution price. A market order generally will execute at or near the current bid (for a sell order) or ask (for a buy order) price. However, it is important for investors to remember that the last-traded price is not necessarily the price at which a market order will be executed.   Limit A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. A buy limit order can only be executed at the limit price or lower, and a sell limit order can only be executed at the limit price or higher. Example: An investor wants to purchase shares of ABC stock for no more than $10. The investor could submit a limit order for this amount and this order will only execute if the price of ABC stock is $10 or lower.   Stop A stop order, also referred to as a stop-loss order is an order to buy or sell a stock once the price of the stock reaches the specified price, known as the stop price. When the stop price is reached, a stop order becomes a market order.   Buy Stop A buy stop order is entered at a stop price above the current market price. Investors generally use a buy stop order to limit a loss or protect a profit on a stock that they have sold short. A sell stop order is entered at a stop price below the current market price. Investors generally use a sell stop order to limit a loss or protect a profit on a stock they own.

Instructions can be found here.\nInstall Hugo    This site is built using hugo so you must have it locally in order to build the site. Instructions for how to install it can be found here.\nRun the Site Locally    At this point, you should have then entire site downloaded locally and a way to run it, so, let\u0026rsquo;s test it! Using the command line, navigate to the location where you cloned econiverse. Once there, run hugo server -D. You should be able to open the website by navigating to localhost:1313 in your browser.\nDownload Atom    This step is recommended. If you already have a text editor and GitHub manager, feel free to skip this step. The rest of this guide will be referencing Atom.\nDownload Atom here.\nEdit the Site!    At this point, you have everything you need to make edits and view them locally. Open Atom, navigate to File -\u0026gt; Add Project Folder, and then add econiverse folder that you previously cloned.\nSite Organization    Menu    The menu is the navigation list on the left side of the website. The contents and organization of the menu can be found in the data -\u0026gt; menu -\u0026gt; main.yml file and more information can be found here. This site uses a bundle menu.\nPages    Contents of each page can be found in the corresponding _index.md file, in the within each folder. When a new page is created, a new folder and a new _index.md file must be created. A list of features that are provided in this submodule and can be used in building this website, such as code blocks, buttons, columns, hints, equations, etc., can be found here.\nCommit and Push    Once your edits are made, and you have previewed them to ensure the site functions correctly, it is time to integrate them to the live website. This can be done by navigating to the Git tab in the bottom right of Atom. Once there, click Stage All, write a short message, and click Commit to main. Then click the Push button that appears in the bottom right. That\u0026rsquo;s it!\nAdding html    Adding html that is outside the scope of hugo and this submodule is not recommended but sometimes unavoidable, such as adding videos. To do this, navigate to the layouts -\u0026gt; shortcodes folder. Create a file that ends with .html, such as mycode.html and insert your html code in here. This code can then be used in any page by using {{\u0026lt; mycode \u0026gt;}}.\nTo insert a .mp4 video, for example, you can use the html shortcode that has already been created. Store the video in the static -\u0026gt; videos folder, and insert the video in any page using {{\u0026lt; addmp4vid myvideofile \u0026gt;}}.\n"},{"id":33,"href":"/help_build_econiverse/edit_with_web_browser/","title":"Edit With Web Browser","parent":"Help Build Econiverse","content":"To edit a page thorough a web browser, first navigate to the page that you would like to edit and then click the \u0026ldquo;Edit this page\u0026rdquo; button at the top right of the page.\n   Edit Button   This will then bring you to the GitHub repo and you will be shown the file that contains the page you wish to edit.
