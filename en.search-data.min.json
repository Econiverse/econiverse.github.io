Let‚Äôs presume you despot $100 into you Cash account. You would now have $100 ‚ÄúBuying Power‚Äù. Should the investor wish to buy a certain security/stock the investor must have the cash available in the brokerage account equal to the total cost.\nExample; Company ABC is trading at $50 per share and you wish to purchase two shares ‚Äì You would need to have $100 (2 Shares @$50 each) available in your cash account.\nDepending on your brokerage, you may need to pay a fee also known as commission to your Broker to submit and exercise this trade on your behalf. This fee/commission needs to be paid with the overall transaction to exercise your trade.\nIf we use the above example; Company ABC is trading at $50 per share and you wish to purchase two shares, your Broker has a fee of $10 per trade ‚Äì You would need to have $110 (2 Shares @$50 each = $100 + $10 fee for broker) in your Cash Account for this trade to be valid and submitted and be filled.\n Selling with a Cash Account:    Following on from the above example, two weeks passed and Company ABC is now trading at $60 per share. You wish to sell or exit your position. You‚Äôd put in a sell order through your broker to sell your two shares. In this example at $60 each. Once the sell order is executed, you‚Äôd have to wait T+2 Days (where is Transaction day + 2 BUSINESS days), once this T+2 period passes the $120 will be reflected in your cash account usually as ‚ÄôBuying Power‚Äô. Until the trade settles, you can\u0026rsquo;t withdraw the money from your brokerage account or use it to make anther purchase.\nMargin Account    A Margin Account allows an investor to borrow against the dollar value of the assets (Cash and/or Securities/shares can be assets) in the account. Investors can use margin accounts to leverage their positions. What does margin and leverage mean? Margin is basically another word for loan/borrow and Leverage is a fancy word for advantage (in your favour).\nLeverage is usually a ratio of sorts (2:1, 4:1, 10:1 or 20:1 for example). In the examples we will use a leverage ratio of 2:1, meaning for every dollar of value you have in your account, your broker is willing to let you borrow two dollars ‚Äì another way to think of it is; for every dollar you have in your brokerage account your broker is willing to loan you two dollars. So let‚Äôs presume your margin account has $5,000 in it, your broker is willing to lend $10,000 you OR allow you to borrow $10,000 ‚Äì as that will be a 2:1 ratio.\nNow, with every loan you take there is interest, and this loan is no different. Your Broker will advise you of the interest rate ‚Äì usually a percentage (%) ‚Äì for the Margin account to which you are required to pay, basically a fee for using their funds.\nBuying example with interest    This section is still a work in progress. You can help by contributing knowledge!\nExample of short position? + Margin call    This section is still a work in progress. You can help by contributing knowledge!\nExample of both Cash and Margin side-by-side where stock goes up:    For example, presume both Cash and Margin Accounts have $5,000 deposited with the Margin given a leverage of 2:1. Additionally the broker has no fee/commission to factor in.\nWeek 1 BUYING - Company ABC is trading at $200 per share\nWeek 2 ‚Äì SELLING Company ABC trading at $300 per share\nWeek 1    Cash Account (Week 1)\n$5,000 allows the Investor to buy 25 Shares at $200 per share.\nMargin Account (Week 1)\n$10,000 allows the investor to buy 50 shares at $200 per share.\nSo you can see from the above example that both accounts had the same $5,000 deposited to use, the Cash account ended up with 25 Shares while the Margin account still with $5,000 deposited but leveraged 2:1 through their broker ended up with 50 shares.\nNow let‚Äôs fast forward a week and sell our shares.\nWeek 2    Cash Account (Week 2)\nSelling 25 shares at $300 per share would equate to $7,500. After T+2 Days you‚Äôd have available $7,500 to trade with or withdraw from your brokerage account to say buy yourself something nice.\nMargin Account (Week 2)\nSelling 50 shares at $300 per share would equate to $15,000 and your buying powers would available immediately avoiding the T+2 waiting period.\nExample of both Cash and Margin side-by-side where stock goes down:    This section is still a work in progress.

The most popular method is to exchange a fiat currency for it, such as the United States Dollar, or to exchange other cryptocurrencies for it, such as Bitcoin. This exchange of one store of value for another is done on an - exchange. There are two types of exchanges, centralized and decentralized.\n   How to Exchange  Centralized Exchange Decentralized exchange   How to Store  Software Wallets Hardware Wallets Paper Wallets       How to Exchange    Centralized Exchange    Centralized exchanges utilize an internal closed system in order to match trades. They operate for profit and are usually very user friendly. Centralized exchanges are where most people begin with purchasing cryptocurrency.\nSince centralized exchanges hold the private keys to your cryptocurrency, you do not technically own them - the exchange does. Because of this, it is very important to trust the exchange that you use.  Some popular centralized exchanges are:\n Binance Coinbase Kraken Bittrex Gemini  Decentralized exchange    Decentralized exchanges utilize a peer to peer system and smart contracts in order to match orders. Since there is no central entity, the government cannot track transactions or forcefully impose taxes and regulations. With decentralized exchanges, you hold your private keys, and thus, the ability to spend your cryptocurrency without relying on a central entity. You must have a wallet to use a decentralized exchange.\nSome popular decentralized exchanges are:\n Uniswap PancakeSwap MDEX 1Inch  How to Store    Software Wallets    Each blockchain offers a way to hold the asset that is specific to that chain. These are commonly called wallets and may be offered by the same team that has built the chain or by a 3rd party. For example, a list of Bitcoin wallets can be found here.\nSome cryptocurrencies are built on top of an existing blockchain and use the same wallet that the blockchain does. For example, Dai is a stable coin built on Ethereum and can be held in any ETH Wallet.\nHardware Wallets    While software wallets are convenient to use and easily integrate with websites or apps, they are considered one of the less secure options since they are connected to the internet. To mitigate this risk, some users prefer to use a hardware wallet. Hardware wallets are physical devices that typically connect over USB to a computer. Some examples of hardware wallets are:\n Ledger Trezor KeepKey  Paper Wallets    For people with large holdings or those who want a different medium to store their digital currency, paper wallets offer a more traditional solution. They are just that - the unique code that allows you to move cryptocurrency from that wallet is printed out on paper. When you want to make a transaction, the QR code must be scanned.

This type of order guarantees that the order will be executed, but does not guarantee the execution price. A market order generally will execute at or near the current bid (for a sell order) or ask (for a buy order) price. However, it is important for investors to remember that the last-traded price is not necessarily the price at which a market order will be executed.   Limit A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. A buy limit order can only be executed at the limit price or lower, and a sell limit order can only be executed at the limit price or higher. Example: An investor wants to purchase shares of ABC stock for no more than $10. The investor could submit a limit order for this amount and this order will only execute if the price of ABC stock is $10 or lower.   Stop A stop order, also referred to as a stop-loss order is an order to buy or sell a stock once the price of the stock reaches the specified price, known as the stop price. When the stop price is reached, a stop order becomes a market order.   Buy Stop A buy stop order is entered at a stop price above the current market price. Investors generally use a buy stop order to limit a loss or protect a profit on a stock that they have sold short. A sell stop order is entered at a stop price below the current market price. Investors generally use a sell stop order to limit a loss or protect a profit on a stock they own.

This location is represented in the form of numbers, such as [65.156.112.48]. Since this is a unique location, it can be used to identify your physical location and track your activity across the internet.\nA VPN is a service that routes all traffic from your device to the VPN providers servers, and then they use their IP address to send your data across the internet. Thus, if anyone was to trace your activity on the internet, it would trace back to your VPN provider.\nIn addition, since the information sent between your device and your VPN provider is encrypted, your internet service provider will no longer be able to view your activity.\nIf you use a VPN, your privacy is only as good as your VPN provider. The provider may log your activity and then sell these to 3rd parties or hand them over to governments. Be very weary of free VPN providers, since they all have to pay bills somehow.  General Recommendations\n Use a VPN and pay for it - a list of recommended VPNs can be found here Look for evidence of a no logging privacy and consider using a VPN that is based outside of Five Eyes Consider using a provider who uses RAM-Only servers that they own Consider a provider who provides an anonymous subscription  DNS    All internet locations are represented by numbers. A Domain Name System (DNS) service maintains a list of which numbers correspond with which alphabetic names for each website. For example, this website is https://econiverse.github.io which when searched with a DNS lookup service, is associated with 185.199.109.153 (a GitHub ip address).\nSince a DNS service provider is taking alphabetic website requests and translating it to the numerical representation, they have knowledge of every website that you visit. Some of these providers log and even sell this data for profit. There are a few steps you can take to protect against these practices.\nGeneral Recommendations\n Change your DNS service provider to one that you trust. Quad9 - 9.9.9.9 and Cloudflare - 1.1.1.1 are two great places to start. Quad9 is a non-profit organization that does not collect personal data and Cloudflare is one of the fastest DNS providers who promise to be transparent \u0026amp; to not sell your personal data. Enable Secure DNS. This encrypts the request between your device and the DNS provider so that anyone watching cannot see what site you are requesting.

Brokers must provide you with the information on how to escalate further, but generally try to avoid this happening at all costs as they do not want unresolved complaints escalated. Take a look at the annual escalations that actually make it to the Ombudsman.\nhttps://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/Office_of_Ombudsman_Report.pdf\nYour Broker\u0026rsquo;s Compliance Department    Lodge an official complaint with your broker\u0026rsquo;s compliance department: Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) Issues on transfer? Margin calls without having a margin account? Questionable activity around your GME holdings? Refusal or delay in DRS transfer requests?\nBrokers typically make every effort to resolve your concerns when you lodge an official complaint as they become a matter of public record. For official complaints, they must action and respond quickly, and if you are not satisfied with full resolution of your complaint you can escalate to the FINRA, the SEC and the Ombudsman.\nDRS Transfer issues and an escalation resource    Legally, your broker must still EXPEDITE your transfer request to Computershare, even though Computershare is not a broker and does not fall under the ACATS 3-day rules. You should not have to transfer between brokers only to transfer to Computershare. You can hold your broker accountable through FINRA Rule 11870 (2) by lodging an official complaint, and escalating to the Ombudsman if they do not resolve your complaint in a timely manner.\nFrom the FINRA website: FINRA regulations for broker to broker transfers and non ACATS transfer requests:\nhttps://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/11870\n(2) If a customer desires to transfer a portion of his or her account outside of the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS), authorized alternate instructions should be transmitted to the carrying member indicating such intent and specifying the designated assets to be transferred. Although such transfers are not subject to the provisions of this Rule, members must expedite all authorized account asset transfers***, whether through ACATS or via other means permissible*** under this Rule, and coordinate their activities with respect thereto.\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)    The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Title 5 of the United States Code, section 552, provides that any person has the right to request access to Federal agency records or information.
