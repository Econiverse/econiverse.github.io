Your buying power equals the amount of money you\u0026rsquo;ve deposited into the account.\nBuying with a Cash Account    Assume you deposit $100 into your Cash Account. If you wish to buy shares of a company, ABC, trading at $50 per share, you would need $100 available to buy two shares.\nYour broker might charge a fee, or commission, to execute the trade. For example, if the broker\u0026rsquo;s fee is $10 per trade, you would need $110 in your Cash Account to buy two shares of ABC at $50 each.  Selling with a Cash Account    After selling your shares, you must wait for the trade to settle—usually T+2 business days (Transaction day plus two business days)—before you can withdraw the proceeds or use them to make another purchase.\nMargin Account    A Margin Account lets you leverage your positions by borrowing against the value of the assets in the account.\nMargin is essentially a loan, and leverage is the advantage it provides. For instance, with a 2:1 leverage ratio, you could borrow two dollars for every dollar in your account. If your account contains $5,000, your broker might allow you to borrow $10,000. Keep in mind that brokers charge interest on margin loans.\nBuying with a Margin Account    If you have $5,000 in your Margin Account and a 2:1 leverage ratio, you could buy up to $10,000 worth of stock—double the amount you could buy with a Cash Account. If ABC shares are trading at $200, you could buy 50 shares. However, you\u0026rsquo;ll owe interest on the $5,000 you borrowed.\nShorting and Margin Calls    With a Margin Account, you can also short sell stocks. Short selling is selling a stock you don\u0026rsquo;t own, with the hope of buying it back later at a lower price to make a profit.\nWhen you short sell, your broker lends you the stock, which you immediately sell. If the stock price drops, you can buy the stock back at the lower price and return it to your broker, keeping the difference.\nBut if the stock price goes up, you could face a margin call. This is a demand from your broker to deposit more money or securities to cover potential losses from the short sale. If you can\u0026rsquo;t meet the margin call, your broker can sell securities from your account without your approval.\nCash vs. Margin: Comparing Performance    Let\u0026rsquo;s consider two accounts, each starting with $5,000, and a broker that doesn\u0026rsquo;t charge commissions. The Margin Account has a 2:1 leverage ratio.\nWeek 1: Buying\nCompany ABC trades at $200 per share.\n Cash Account: Buys 25 shares ($5,000 / $200) Margin Account: Buys 50 shares (2 * $5,000 / $200)  Week 2: Selling With Price Increase\nCompany ABC trades at $300 per share.\n Cash Account: Sells 25 shares for $7,500. After T+2 days, the funds are available. Margin Account: Sells 50 shares for $15,000. The funds are immediately available.  Week 2: Selling With Price Decrease\nLet\u0026rsquo;s imagine that instead of rising, the price of ABC shares falls to $100 in the second week.\n Cash Account: Selling 25 shares would only yield $2,500. You\u0026rsquo;ve lost half your initial investment. Margin Account: Selling 50 shares would yield $5,000. However, because you borrowed $5,000, you\u0026rsquo;re left with nothing from your initial investment. Plus, if the stock price fell drastically, you might owe more than your initial investment due to a \u0026ldquo;margin call,\u0026rdquo; when the broker demands additional funds to cover potential losses.

The most popular method is to exchange fiat currency, such as the United States Dollar, or other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, for it. This exchange of one store of value for another is done on an exchange. There are two types of exchanges: centralized and decentralized.\n   How to Exchange  Centralized Exchange Decentralized Exchange   How to Store  Software Wallets Hardware Wallets Paper Wallets       How to Exchange    Centralized Exchange    Centralized exchanges utilize an internal closed system to match trades. They operate for profit and are usually user-friendly, making them a common starting point for purchasing cryptocurrency.\nSince centralized exchanges hold the private keys to your cryptocurrency, you technically do not own them—the exchange does. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to trust the exchange you use.  Some popular centralized exchanges include:\n Binance Bittrex Coinbase Gemini Kraken  Decentralized Exchange    Decentralized exchanges utilize a peer-to-peer system and smart contracts to match orders. With no central entity, governments cannot track transactions or impose taxes and regulations forcefully. With decentralized exchanges, you hold your private keys, granting you the ability to spend your cryptocurrency without relying on a central entity. To use a decentralized exchange, you must have a wallet.\nSome popular decentralized exchanges include:\n 1Inch MDEX PancakeSwap SushiSwap Uniswap Balancer Curve Finance  How to Store    Software Wallets    Each blockchain offers a specific way to hold its assets, commonly referred to as wallets. These wallets may be provided by the blockchain\u0026rsquo;s development team or third-party providers. For example, a list of Bitcoin wallets can be found here. Some cryptocurrencies built on existing blockchains can use the same wallets as their underlying blockchain. For instance, Dai is a stablecoin built on Ethereum and can be held in any ETH Wallet.\nSome popular software wallets include:\n Exodus Jaxx Liberty Metamask MyEtherWallet Trust Wallet Atomic Wallet  Hardware Wallets    While software wallets are convenient and easily integrate with websites or apps, they are considered less secure since they are connected to the internet. To mitigate this risk, some users prefer hardware wallets. Hardware wallets are physical devices that typically connect to a computer via USB. Here are some examples of hardware wallets:\n KeepKey Ledger Trezor Ellipal SafePal  Paper Wallets    For users with significant holdings or those seeking an alternative medium to store their digital currency, paper wallets offer a more traditional solution. They involve printing out the unique code that allows you to access and transfer your cryptocurrency. When making a transaction, you scan the QR code on the paper.

Additionally, evaluate your current DNS security level by performing a leak test here or here to ensure the confidentiality of your private data.\nVPN    Your unique digital identifier, the IP address, can unintentionally expose your physical whereabouts and internet browsing patterns.\nVirtual Private Networks (VPNs) help obscure your digital tracks by redirecting your traffic through their servers, effectively concealing your IP address with theirs. This process encrypts your data transmission, shielding your Internet Service Provider (ISP) from inspecting your online activities.\nBear in mind, your online privacy is directly tied to the trustworthiness of your VPN provider. Unethical providers may log your digital activities and sell this data to third parties or disclose them to authorities. Consequently, be wary when considering free VPN services.  Actionable Recommendations\n Commit to a reputable, paid VPN service. Use this recommended VPNs list for guidance. Prioritize a VPN provider with a strict no-logs policy, ideally operating outside the jurisdiction of the Five Eyes surveillance alliance. Opt for providers that utilize RAM-Only servers under their direct control. Test the VPN service for any IP or DNS leaks before committing to a long-term subscription. Choose a VPN with strong encryption protocols and support for OpenVPN.  DNS    The Domain Name System (DNS), a cornerstone of the web browsing process, transforms human-friendly website names into machine-readable numerical addresses. This crucial conversion, however, gives DNS providers a peek into your web browsing history, which could potentially be exploited for profit.\nActionable Recommendations\n Shift to a secure and trustworthy DNS service provider. Quad9 - 9.9.9.9 and Cloudflare - 1.1.1.1 are robust options, both pledging to protect personal data. Enable Secure DNS, an encryption tool that fortifies the communication between your device and the DNS provider, thereby enhancing your online privacy.  Follow this comprehensive guide to enable Secure DNS on various web browsers. Android users can refer to these step-by-step instructions.   Set up DNS over HTTPS or DNS over TLS, which provides an extra layer of security by encrypting DNS queries. Regularly run DNS leak tests to ensure that your DNS provider is not exposing your browsing history.

This remains true even if your password has been compromised.\nMethods of Two-Factor Authentication    There are several prevalent approaches to implementing 2FA:\n  SMS or Email Codes: In this method, a unique code is sent to your registered mobile number or email address. This code must be entered during the login process to prove your identity.\n  Mobile App Authenticator: Several organizations offer dedicated mobile apps that generate unique verification codes. These apps, linked to your account, generate one-time passwords to use during the login process.\n  Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP): TOTP is a widely adopted approach which creates temporary codes based on the current time. Renowned authenticator apps like Authy can store and synchronize your 2FA accounts across various devices.\n  The Imperative of 2FA    It\u0026rsquo;s strongly recommended to enable 2FA wherever possible to enhance your account security. The use of a secondary authentication factor significantly reduces the likelihood of unwanted access to your sensitive information.\nAdditionally, maintaining strong, unique passwords, keeping your devices and apps up-to-date, and practicing good digital hygiene are essential to a robust security stance.\nEmbrace the robust protection of Two-Factor Authentication to fortify your online presence!\n"},{"id":32,"href":"/due_diligence/macrofinance_movie_list/","title":"Macrofinance Movie List for Enthusiasts","parent":"Due Diligence Guide","content":"This is a carefully curated collection of documentaries, movies, and video clips spanning across multiple platforms that provide unique insights into the world of macrofinance.\n   Ghost Exchange Hank: 5 Years From the Brink Dirty Money  Drug Short (Vyera \u0026amp; Valeant Pharmaceuticals) The Wagon Wheel (Wells Fargo)   Goldman Sachs: Master of The World?

The underlying foundation of TA rests upon the analysis of human psychology, specifically in understanding how price fluctuations, in conjunction with other market indicators, impact the decision-making process of investors, leading to either buying or selling of a security.\nAn integral part of this analytical process involves the use of tools such as chart patterns, oscillators, support or resistance levels, and moving averages among others. It\u0026rsquo;s important to emphasize that these tools shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be used in isolation. Instead, they should be synergistically employed to create a comprehensive picture of the market dynamics. By corroborating multiple signals, analysts can effectively confirm or reject any hypotheses formulated during their analysis.\nThis multi-faceted approach not only fosters a thorough understanding of the market dynamics but also bolsters the accuracy of predictive forecasting. This, in turn, facilitates informed decision-making in the ever-changing and often volatile financial markets, thereby empowering traders to navigate the complex financial landscape with increased confidence and precision.\n"},{"id":73,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"","content":""},{"id":74,"href":"/fundamentals/blockchain/blockchain_overview/","title":"Understanding Blockchain","parent":"Guide to Blockchain","content":"    Cryptography \u0026amp; Blockchain (Blockchainhub)   "}]
